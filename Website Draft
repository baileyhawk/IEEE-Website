<p>Welcome to our website! This is a work in progress.</p>

<p>IEEE is a student-run organization which means that all active members are able to vote on which projects will be worked on throughout the semester.  Students may design a formal presentation detailing their project idea discussing components like cost, feasibility, and originality. One of our projects that will be carried over to this year is a LiDAR-sensing autonomous vehicle.  Previous projects include an LED dance floor which was created for an Engineering formal and new control system for the bells of Pully Bell by Cook Field. Additionally, workshops are held outside of our weekly chapter meetings for lecture/hands-on education on topics such as prototyping (breadboards, Arduinos, resistors), Python programming, or speakers from the Engineering department.</p>
